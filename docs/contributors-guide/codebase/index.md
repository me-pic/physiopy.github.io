## Contribution workflow

There are many descriptions of a good contribution workflow out there.
For instance, we suggest to have a look at [tedana's workflow](https://github.com/ME-ICA/tedana/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#making-a-change).
At `physiopy`, we follow a very similar workflow. The only three
differences are:

- If you see an open issue that you would like to work on, check if it
  is assigned. If it is, ask the assignee if they need help or want to
  be substituted before starting to work on it.
- We ask you to test the code locally before merging it, and then, if
  possible, write some automatic tests for the code to be run in our
  Continuous Integration! Check the testing section below to know
  more.
- We suggest opening a draft PR as soon as you can - so it's easier
  for us to help you!

You can find more in-detail description of this process in the following sections of the guide.
