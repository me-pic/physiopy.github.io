## Issues and Milestones

At `physiopy`, we use Issues and Milestones to keep track of and
organise our workflow.  **Issues** describe pieces of work that need to
be completed to move the project forwards. We try to keep them as simple
and clear as possible: an issue should describe a unitary, possibly
small piece of work (unless it's about refactoring). Don't be scared of
opening many issues at once, if it makes sense! Just check that what
you're proposing is not listed in a previous issue (open or closed) yet
(we don't like doubles). Issues get labelled. That helps the
contributors to know what they're about. Check the label list to know
what types are there, and use them accordingly! Issues can also be
**assigned**. If you want to work on an assigned issue, ask permission
first! - **Milestones** set the higher level workflow. They sketch
deadlines and important releases. Issues are assigned to these
milestones by the maintainers. If you feel that an issue should be
assigned to a specific milestone but the maintainers have not done so,
discuss it in the issue chat or in Gitter! We might have just missed it,
or we might not (yet) see how it aligns with the overall project
structure/milestone.
