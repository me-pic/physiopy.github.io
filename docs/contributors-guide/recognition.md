### How it works
We welcome and recognize [all
contributions](https://allcontributors.org/docs/en/specification) from
documentation to testing to event organizing to code development. For each repository on Github, you can see the current list of contributors in the README (kept up to date by the [all
contributors bot](https://allcontributors.org/docs/en/bot/overview)). The type of contribution is reflected by the corresponding [emoji key](https://allcontributors.org/docs/en/emoji-key). You can also check our [Team](/community/team) for a summary of the many contributions that have been made to Physiopy as a whole. To ensure your contributions are recognized, please use Github as described in the accompanying sections of the guide!

### Other pathways for recognition
Physiopy frequently submits posters, talks, and other projects to academic events. We typically extend authorship to all those involved in relevant development activity during the corresponding time frame. As well, we explicitly collect detailed authorship information and credentials from contributors to our [*Community Practices* documentation](https://physiopy-community-guidelines.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html). These kinds of recognition are usually coordinated over Slack and/or email, so be sure you are connected with us there and responsive to any relevant communications.

### What if you believe your contribution is not being recognized?
It might take us a little while to update contributions everywhere they should be, but we want to make sure nothing is overlooked! If you have questions or concerns, contact the project manager at [physiopy.community@gmail.com](mailto:physiopy.community@gmail.com).
