# Getting started 

## Connecting with Physiopy

As mentionned in the introduction, all Physiopy's projects are developped by the community, for the community. As a new contributor, a good first step is thus to connect with us (no worry, we are friendly) ! There are multiple way to jump on the Physiopy train, find what is best for you : 

### Slack



### Monthly meetings

We are meeting every month on Zoom to discuss the progress of the different projects within the community, and also the direction for future ones. To join our meeting, please send an email at physiopy.community@gmail.com. See you next month !

### Github-based communication

We're trying to keep all conversation related to project development in GitHub issues.

### Codesprints & hackathon

Nothing like some hands on coding session to get to know the community ! Every semester, we gather virtually to collaboratively work on the update of the different Physiopy's libraries. 

Not much of a coder (yet) ? Those events are still for you ! It is a great time to discuss with other member of the community, and to receive more support on your coding journey.
